# dockstore-cgpwgs

`dockstore-cgpwgs` provides a complete multi threaded WGS analysis for SNV, INDEL, SV and Copynumber
variation with associated annotation of VCF files.  This has been packaged specifically for use with
the [Dockstore.org](https://dockstore.org/) framework.

## Usage

This is intended to be run using the Dockstore.org framework under docker but can be executed as a
normal docker container (or imported into singularity.

See the [dockstore execution method here][dockstore-cgpwgs].

You should see the usage for the `ds-cgpwgs.pl` script for all parameters (or the `cwl` definition).

Required input files are

1. Tumour BAM file
1. Normal BAM file
1. Core reference archive (e.g. [core_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz][ftp-ref])
1. WXS reference archive (e.g. [SNV_INDEL_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz][ftp-ref])
1. WGS reference archive (e.g. [CNV_SV_ref_GRCh37d5_brass6+.tar.gz][ftp-ref])
1. VAGrENT (annotation) reference archive (e.g. [VAGrENT_ref_GRCh37d5_ensembl_75.tar.gz][ftp-ref])
1. Subclonal reference archive ([SUBCL_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz][ftp-ref])
  * Only needed if `skipbb` is `false`
1. QC reference archive (e.g. [qcGenotype_GRCh37d5.tar.gz][ftp-ref])

Inputs 1&2 are expected to have been mapped using [dockstore-cgpmap][dockstore-cgpmap]

Please check the Wiki then raise an issue if you require additional information on how to generate
your own reference files.  Much of this information is available on the individual algorithm wiki
pages (or the subsequently linked protocols papers).

	* [ascatNgs][ascatngs-wiki]
* Inherited from dockstore-cgpwxs:
	* [cgpCaVEManWrapper][caveman-wiki]

	* [VAGrENT][vagrent-wiki]


### Usable Cores

When running outside of a docker container you can set the number of CPUs via:

* `export CPU=N`
* `-cores|-c` option of `ds-cgpwgs.pl`

If not set detects available cores on system.

## Other uses

### Native docker

All of the tools installed as part of [dockstore-cgpmap][dockstore-cgpmap] and
[dockstore-cgpwxs][dockstore-cgpwxs] and the above packages are available for direct use.

```
export CGPWGS_VER=X.X.X
docker pull quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpwgs:$CGPWGS_VER
docker --rm -ti [--volume ...] quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpwgs:$CGPWGS_VER bash
```

### Singularity

The resulting docker container has been tested with Singularity.  The command to exec is:

```
ds-cgpwgs.pl -h
```

Expected use would be along the lines of:

```
export CGPWGS_VER=X.X.X
singularity pull docker://quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpwgs:$CGPWGS_VER

singularity exec\
 --workdir /.../workspace  \
 --home /.../workspace:/home  \
 --bind /.../ref/human:/var/spool/ref:ro  \
 --bind /.../example_data/cgpwgs:/var/spool/data:ro  \
 dockstore-cgpwgs-${CGPWGS_VER}.simg  \
  ds-cgpwgs.pl \
   -reference /var/spool/ref/core_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz \
   -annot /var/spool/ref/VAGrENT_ref_GRCh37d5_ensembl_75.tar.gz \
   -snv_indel /var/spool/ref/SNV_INDEL_ref_GRCh37d5-fragment.tar.gz \
   -tumour /var/spool/data/COLO-829_ex.cram \
   ...
```

For a system automatically attaching _all local mount points_ (not default singularity behaviour)
you need not specify any `exec` params (workdir, home, bind) but you should specify the `-outdir`
option for `ds-cgpwgs.pl` to prevent data being written to your home directory.

By default results are written to the home directory of the container so ensure you bind
a large volume and set the `-home` variable.  As indicated above the location can be overridden
via the options of `ds-cgpwgs.pl`

## Verifying your deployment

The `examples/` tree contains test json files populated with data that can be used to verify the
tool.  More details can be found [here](examples/README.md).

The `expected/` tree contains the expected output for each tool.  More details can be found [here](expected/README.md).

## Example data

The data linked in the 'examples' area is from the cell line COLO-829.

## Diagram of internals

This diagram was generated based on v1.1.0, it does not describe any of the file provisioning
handled by a Dockstore run.

## Development environment

This project uses git pre-commit hooks.  Please enable them to prevent inappropriate large files
being included.  Any pull request found not to have adhered to this will be rejected and the branch
will need to be manually cleaned to keep the repo size down.

Activate the hooks with

```
git config core.hooksPath git-hooks
```

## Release process

This project is maintained using HubFlow.

1. Make appropriate changes
1. Build image locally
1. Run all example inputs and verify any changes are acceptable
1. Update `expected/` tree with output of last step
1. Bump version in `Dockerfile` and `Dockstore.cwl`
1. Push changes
1. Check state on Travis
1. Update expected datasets
1. Generate the release (add notes to GitHub)
1. Confirm that image has been built on [quay.io][quay-builds]
1. Update the [dockstore][dockstore-cgpwgs] entry, see [their docs][dockstore-get-started].
