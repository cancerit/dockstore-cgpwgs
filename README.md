`dockstore-cgpwgs` provides a complete multi threaded WGS analysis for SNV, INDEL, SV and Copynumber variation with associated annotation of VCF files.  This has been packaged specifically for use with the [Dockstore.org](https://dockstore.org/) framework.

Required input files are

1. Tumour BAM file
2. Normal BAM file
3. Core reference archive (e.g. [core_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/cancer/dockstore/human/))
4. WXS reference archive (e.g. [SNV_INDEL_ref_GRCh37d5.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/cancer/dockstore/human/))
... WIP ...
5. VAGrENT (annotation) reference archive (e.g. [VAGrENT_ref_GRCh37d5_ensembl_75.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/cancer/dockstore/human/))

Inputs 1&2 are expected to have been mapped using [dockstore-cgpmap](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpmap).

@TODO
The data linked in the 'examples' area is a tiny section of chr21 from the cell line COLO-829.  This will generate a small number of INDEL and SNV variants.
All the SNV variants do not pass filtering (several only fail as not in a gene footprint, 'F009').

Please check the Wiki then raise an issue if you require additional information on how to generate your own reference files.  Much of this information is available on the individual algorithm pages.

Release process
===============
This project is maintained using HubFlow.

1. Make appropriate changes
2. Bump version in `Dockerfile` and `Dockstore.cwl`
3. Push changes
4. Check state on Travis
5. Generate the release (add notes to GitHub)
6. Confirm that image has been built on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpwgs?tab=builds)
7. Update the [dockstore](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgpwgs) entry, see [their docs](https://dockstore.org/docs/getting-started-with-dockstore).
